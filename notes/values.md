- in Go lang each variable we have to used other wise go compiler give error
- `int` have many types like int8 , int16 , int32 , int64 but majority time we just used int and go compiler optimize it as per CPU architecture 
- Constant are the value which remain the same during the entire program end do not change declare using const keyword same as JavaScript
- `:=` declare variable and infer the type of the variable , work only inside the function , reassign value later of the same data types `age := 18`, value is mandatory 

- `=` declare variable with specific data type , do not require assignment of the variable at declaration time, used with var keyword , work inside or outside of the function
- `var variableName dataType = value` -> `var age int = 18`
